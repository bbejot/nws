...ENHANCED THREAT FOR THE SPREAD OF WILDFIRES THIS AFTERNOON...

Minimum relative humidity values will drop to between 25 and 30 
percent across portions of northern and central Virginia while 
west to northwest winds gust frequently between 25 and 35 mph. The
strongest winds will coincide with the lowest relative humidity 
during the mid to late afternoon hours.

Fuel moisture will dry out during this time. The combination of 
low fuel moisture, low relative humidity, and gusty winds will 
enhance the threat for the spread of wildfires. 

Outdoor burning is strongly discouraged during this time. Please
refer to your local burn permitting authority on whether you can 
burn. If you do burn, use extreme caution and ensure fire 
suppression is readily available.
