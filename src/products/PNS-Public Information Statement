Narrative:

Today, the National Weather Service in Sterling, Virginia, 
conducted a survey of storm damage in Centreville, Virgina, of
localized damage from storms that occurred Thursday evening, 
March 31, 2022.

It was determined that a brief tornado occurred in Centreville, 
Virginia, near the end of Batavia Drive behind Cub Run Elementary 
School. Multiple softwood pine trees surrounding the end of 
Batavia Drive were impacted/damaged by the tornado, with several 
snapped and others uprooted. No damage to nearby residences or 
other structures was evident during the survey. The tornado was 
on the ground for well under a minute.

The tornado touched down immediately east of Cub Run Elementary
School and transited from west to east toward the cul-de-sac at 
the end of Batavia Drive. The cul-de-sac was formerly surrounded 
by about two dozen trees. The seven trees on the south side of the
cul-de-sac were undamaged, while most of the remainder were 
either uprooted, snapped at the base, or snapped 10-15 feet in the
air. One of the tree tops was turned in mid-air and landed 
opposite to its expected orientation had this been straight-line 
winds, indicative of a very brief tornado touchdown.

The tornado lifted as it moved east of the cul-de-sac.

Weather radars from NOAA/NWS KLWX WSR-88D in Sterling, VA, 
and FAA Terminal Doppler Weather Radars for Reagan National 
Airport, and Joint Base Andrews, all had corroborating doppler
radar velocity data supporting the tornadogenesis.

EF Scale: The Enhanced Fujita Scale classifies tornadoes into the 
following categories:

EF0.........65 to 85 mph
EF1.........86 to 110 mph
EF2.........111 to 135 mph
EF3.........136 to 165 mph
EF4.........166 to 200 mph
EF5.........>200 mph
